Describing your dataset and what data it contains:
This dataset contains 117 columns and 220,740 rows 
There are two data types, number and string
Some of the columns include measures of population, employees, workers, access to water and land, low wage workers, medium wage workers, and high wage workers, etc. 
Every block group in the United States is assigned a National Walkability Index score. The National Walkability Index is based on measures of the built environment that affect the probability of whether people walk as a mode of transportation: street intersection density, proximity to transit stops, and diversity of land uses. 
National Walkability Index scores on a scale of 1 to 20, where 1 represents the least walkable cities, and 20 is the most.
The significance of this dataset is that it links walkability with key economic and demographic factors—like income, employment, job growth, population, and housing—which allows leaders to see where walkable communities exist and who benefits from them.

The 2 questions the team generated and why they are interesting and important:

Question 1: How is walkability in the United States impacted by employment industry?
Walkability is a significant factor in sustainability, urban planning, and economic growth
By understanding how walkability changes in relation to employment industry, we can see how different employment industries shape the land use mix and investment in transportation
We can also use this information to see how variances in walkability index may attract different members of the workforce
To investigate this relationship, we generated two histograms comparing National Walkability Index scores across block groups with differing levels of industrial and office employment

Question 2: How does walkability influence the number of high income workers among cities?
This can help explain wage inequality amongst cities and explain how some cities grow much faster than others because of the benefits of having these workers.
Helps support urban planning and investing in accessibility for all people through better transit, more sidewalks, bike lanes, etc.
This can also help to understand many important economic changes such as an increase in housing prices due to more business and more tax revenue as well.
Helps to show that walkability improves quality-of-life factors and is a major indicator of where high wage workers want to be/will be.

Block Group Flaw
When using this data set, we found an issue that may affect the interpretation of our results
Some block groups used to separate U.S. cities seem to be much larger than they should be
For example, the block group for Atlanta spans an unusually large portion of the state

Analysis and Results:
Question 1: How is walkability in the United States impacted by employment industry? 
The number of industrial workers peaks in cities with moderate walkability index scores (i.e. Athens and Albany, GA, Adrian, MI, and Boise City, ID) with a significant drop off when the score reaches 15
This is largely due to manufacturing and distribution centers requiring larger facilities, highways, and freight capacity which inherently decrease the walkability score
Office employment displays more variability and a broad peak in higher walkability zones between 13 and 19 (i.e. Atlanta, GA, Boston, MA, and Chicago, IL)
This broad peak indicates that office-based industries are more often located in mixed-use districts and dense cities
Our analysis revealed that walkability in U.S. cities is strongly correlated with employment structure, population density, and economic characteristics.
Industrial heavy areas consistently display lower walkability, indicating that infrastructure designed around manufacturing reduces pedestrian access.
Office based employment areas tend to have higher walkability, indicating that business centers typically offer more walking environments.

Question 2: How does walkability influence the number of high income workers among cities?
A high wage worker earns at least $333,000/month.
According to this scatterplot, as the walkability score increases, the number of high wage workers stays roughly the same until the score reaches 16 (blue cluster). At 
16, the number of high wage workers begins to increase exponentially, as shown by the orange and red clusters.
In terms of population, we can see that the mid-level walkability scores have higher populations (blue cluster), as well as around 200-400 high wage workers on average, but as walkability increases, the lower populated areas have a much greater amount of high wage workers, ranging from 1100-2000 on average.
There is a threshold walkability score of about 16, where the average number of high wage workers skyrockets, as seen by our polynomial trend line.
Overall, as walkability increases, so does the average amount of high income workers among US cities.
High walkability scores correlate with a sharp increase in high wage workers, revealing that walkability attracts a higher income population.
These results show that walkability is connected to a city’s economy, quality of life, and overall health. Cities seeking to improve these aspects should invest in pedestrian access and walkability.
